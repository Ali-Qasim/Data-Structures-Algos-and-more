# Test-Projects
 
These are some engaging mini-projects and apps! I made to play around with concepts and technologies!

AnimatedShapes:

This was just me playing around with JFrame and animating a bunch of shapes. Left-click adds a polygon to the JFrame, middle-mouse-button randomises colour, the scroll-wheel increases the size of shapes to be added, and right-click clears everything.

Farmer-Fox-Goose-Corn Puzzle Solver:

This is a program that uses breadth-first search to find the solution to the famous riddle wherein a number of incompatible characters (A farmer, a fox, a goose, and a bag of corn!) must find a way to traverse a river without any of them being eaten.


Tic-Tac-Toe Player:

This is a terminal-based AI tic-tac-toe player! It uses a minimax algorithm to determine the best moves to play against the user.
